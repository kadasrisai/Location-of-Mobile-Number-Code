# Location-of-Mobile-Number-Code

This project offers a simple tool to find the approximate location associated with a mobile number. It employs algorithms to estimate the geographic region linked to a given phone number.

**Features:**
* Mobile Number Location Lookup: Input a mobile number to retrieve its approximate geographic location.  
* Algorithmic Estimation: Utilizes algorithms to infer the possible location based on the mobile number.  

## Technologies Used:
* Python: Backend scripting language used for implementing the location estimation algorithms.

# How to Use:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the project directory.
* Run the Python script location_finder.py.
* Enter a mobile number in the provided input field and click on the "Lookup" button to retrieve its estimated location.

#### So, Let's run the code
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r Requirements
python location_finder.py
```
